NOTES
I took notes from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usZPMKhGMiE
It used an older version of ubuntu but still worked fine. 
In the end I just right clicked on the downloaded file and selected "Open with software install"
Once installed, I searched for it in the "show applications" (bottom right of screen)
I also deleted the downloaded files to keep things neat and tidy

Installing software on ubuntu

First way is via the terminal
sudo apt-get install <name of software>
You can't install this way and also have the synaptic package manager open.
Error: ...is another process using it?


Second way is via the synaptic pagage manager. You need to download the software first then open it in spm. I don't however seem to have spm installed. I have Gdebi package installer instead

The Third way is indeed through the GDebi package installer
Sometime this route throws up an error, so avoid this route if this is the case.

The Fourth way is to open it with "Ubuntu software install" This is found by right clicking the file you have downloaded and choose "Open with software install".
An issue with Ubuntu software install: When I open it from the desktop, it  is not easy to find the downloaded file you wish to install.
