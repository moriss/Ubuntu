Apparantly Need to download this
sudo apt install virtualbox-qt

I'm not sure if it worked but a search for virtual box in bottom right search found it. 

go to 
file>virtual media manager

ubuntu.vdi should be showing in the box but it is not. 

So it's probably best to abort for now and perhaps see about removing software you don't use.
